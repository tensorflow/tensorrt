##  How To Update The Changelog for a New Release ?

 - **Major Version:** Major refactoring, or changes that make the data
                  non-comparable with any previous release of the benchmark.
                  Changes in shell scripts are to be expected.

 - **Minor Version:** Changes that add a new functionality though not modifying
                  existing metrics or models scripts in a way that would make
                  metrics not comparable between minor releases.

 - **Patch Version:** Changes that are expected to have no change to the operation
                  of the benchmark nor the way metrics are calculated.
                  Basically these changes are transparent for the user.
